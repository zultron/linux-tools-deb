Debian packaging for 'linux-tools' to accompany 'linux-rt-deb'

Builds against 3.8.13 with packaging based on sid 3.8.11 [1,2]

What and Why
============

The 'linux-kbuild-<ver>' package is required in order to build kernel
modules against an upstream Debian Linux kernel package.

This package is based on the same kernel sources, and is even
maintained in the same Debian SVN repository, so it's unclear why the
'linux-tools' source package stands separate from the 'linux' package
and requires a separate source tarball generated from a subset of the
files in the Linux source tarball.

In any case, to compile kernel modules against e.g. a custom 3.8
kernel for Wheezy, where no upstream 3.8 kernel exists, a
'linux-kbuild-3.8' package is required.

Building
========

Assuming your downloaded linux tarball is in linux-3.8.13.tar.xz:

mkdir linux-tools && cd linux-tools
git clone https://github.com/zultron/linux-tools-deb.git debian
./debian/bin/genorig.py ../linux-3.8.13.tar.xz
./debian/rules debian/control  # This will fail; read output
./debian/rules orig
./debian/rules clean
dpkg-source -i -I -b .
dpkg-buildpackage -B
cd ..

Updating
========

The linux-tools package version must match that of the kernel.
Updating is easy.

To update to a different version, check out a commit in the upstream
linux-tools packaging [1] with a version close to the target kernel.

All changes to the upstream packaging are (thus far) squashed into the
top-most commit in this tree, so simply cherry-pick the top commit
onto the new branch.

To resolve conflicts in the changelog, just check out the upstream
changelog and manually add and modify the latest changelog entry from
this tree.

There may be conflicts in templates/control.source.in related to the
Build-Depnds: binutils-dev.  In Debian Jessie, the binutils-dev build
dependency is replaced by libiberty-dev.  Copy that minor difference
across.

Add and commit the changes, and the update should be complete.
