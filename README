Debian packaging for 'linux-tools' to accompany 'linux-rt-deb'

Checked out from upstream linux-tools packaging [1,2], rev. 19351,
just prior 3.6 update.

What and Why
============

The 'linux-kbuild-<ver>' package is required in order to build kernel
modules against an upstream Debian Linux kernel package.

This package is based on the same kernel sources, and is even
maintained in the same Debian SVN repository, so it's unclear why the
'linux-tools' source package stands separate from the 'linux' package
and requires a separate source tarball generated from a subset of the
files in the Linux source tarball.

In any case, to compile kernel modules against e.g. a custom 3.5
kernel for Wheezy, where no upstream 3.5 kernel exists, a
'linux-kbuild-3.5' package is required.

Building
========

Assuming your downloaded linux tarball is in linux-3.5.7.tar.xz:

mkdir linux-tools && cd linux-tools
git clone https://github.com/zultron/linux-tools-deb.git debian
./debian/bin/genorig.py ../linux-3.5.7.tar.xz
./debian/rules debian/control  # This will fail; read output
./debian/rules orig
./debian/rules clean
dpkg-source -i -I -b .
dpkg-buildpackage -B
cd ..
